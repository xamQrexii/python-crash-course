Exercise 2-7. Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace
characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each
character combination, "\t" and "\n" , at least once.
Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip() ,
rstrip() , and strip() .
